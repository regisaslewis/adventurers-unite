# Adventurers Unite!
## The world of Silowan awaits.

No one changes the world alone.  
Amass power or wealth.  Raise glory to your god.  Uplift the destitute.  Or merely earn a living to endure for another day.
No matter what, it will take the combined efforts of a Group to succeed.  Be they temporary allies, dear friends, or even endentured subordinates, one must rely on others.

### The Adventurer's Unite Interface

The first task for a user is to either select a group to join or create one of their own. Selecting option 2 will take open up the Group Options, where information can be gathered.
### Group Options

If no current Group has space or the user desires to lead their own group, selecting option 6 will begin the process.

Each of Silowan's 4 major continents are home to various cities, though only some are populous enough to support Adventuring Guilds.  A user must select their starting continent and then a city of sufficient size to support their new Group.
| Continent: | Cities: |
|  :---:  | :--- |
| Bettle | Burg <br> Hommoch <br> Lei |
| Jidoth | Lord's Port <br> Oth <br> Tirena <br> Videlsen |
| Mollen | Aldon <br> Exigot <br> Len City <br> Pelta <br> The Villages of Southern Aldon  <br> Vanna's Perch |
| Rise | Expanse <br> Mouth <br> Shelf |

Crowded cities can offer a lively, bustling ecosystem of Adventurers, though this may also lead to intense competition for resources. The choice of where to begin is up to the Group's Founder.  With option 5, you can check to see how many Groups, if any, belong to a particular city.

Once a Group is established, it's time to get moving.  If ever a user wishes to see the members of a particular group -- whether for scouting purposes or to get a read on competition -- option 9 provides detailed information of each member.

Now that a Group is decided on, it's time for the user to create their character.  From the main menu, select option 2 for a list of Adventurer Options.

Then, a new Adventurer can be created with option 6.

When creating a new Adventurer, a user must choose their Personality Alignment and Job.
| Alignments: | \| | Jobs: |
|  :---  |    :---:    |  :--- |
| Apathetic | \| | Brawler|
| Anarchic | \| | Director |
| Commercial | \| | Feral |
| Philanthropic | \| | Hopeless |
| Political | \| | Lookout |
| Religious | \| | Preacher |
| Social | \| | Shade |
|  | \| | Zealot |

Sometimes, it's useful to see how other users have built their characters to get an idea of popular Alignments for particular Jobs.  Using option 4 of the Adventurer Options submenu will present all Adventurers of a particular alignment

There are more options to choose from, such as updating Groups or Adventurers to move around (or fix errors), deleting Groups that are disbanding or Adventurers who are retiring, and so on.

Go forth, Adventurer, and with your allies make an indombitable mark on Silowan!
