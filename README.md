# Adventurers Unite!
## The world of Silowan awaits.

No one changes the world alone.  
Amass power or wealth.  Raise glory to your god.  Uplift the destitute.  Or merely earn a living to endure for another day.
No matter what, it will take the combined efforts of a Group to succeed.  Be they temporary allies, dear friends, or even endentured subordinates, one must rely on others.

### The Adventurer's Unite Interface

When creating a new Adventurer, a user must choose their Personality Alignment and Job.
| Alignments: | Jobs: |
| :---      |      ---: |
|<table><tr>Apathetic</tr><tr>Anarchic</tr><tr>Commercial</tr><tr>Philanthropic</tr><tr>Political</tr><tr>Religious</tr><tr>Social</tr></table> | <table><tr>Brawler</tr><tr>Director</tr><tr>Feral</tr><tr>Hopeless</tr><tr>Lookout</tr><tr>Preacher</tr><tr>Shade</tr><tr>Zealot</tr></table> |

Sometimes, it's useful to see how other users have built their characters to get an idea of popular Alignments for particular Jobs.  Using option 4 of the Adventurer Options submenu will present all Adventurers of a particular alignment
