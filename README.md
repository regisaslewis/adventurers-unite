# Adventurers Unite!
## The world of Silowan awaits.

No one changes the world alone.  
Amass power or wealth.  Raise glory to your god.  Uplift the destitute.  Or merely earn a living to endure for another day.
No matter what, it will take the combined efforts of a Group to succeed.  Be they temporary allies, dear friends, or even endentured subordinates, one must rely on others.
Through the Adventurer's Unite Interface, a user can create their unique Adventurer and join (or found) a Group of up to four members.
