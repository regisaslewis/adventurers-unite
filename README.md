# Adventurers Unite!
## The world of Silowan awaits.

No one changes the world alone.  
Amass power or wealth.  Raise glory to your god.  Uplift the destitute.  Or merely earn a living to endure for another day.
No matter what, it will take the combined efforts of a Group to succeed.  Be they temporary allies, dear friends, or even endentured subordinates, one must rely on others.

### The Adventurer's Unite Interface

The first task for a user is to either select a group to join or create one of their own. Selecting option 2 will take open up the Group Options, where information can be gathered.

If no current Group has space or the user desires to lead their own group, selecting option 6 will begin the process.

Each of Silowan's 4 major continents are home to various cities, though only some are populous enough to support Adventuring Guilds.  A user must select their starting continent and then a city of sufficient size to support their new Group.
| Continent: | Cities: |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bettle | Burg <br> Hommoch <br> Lei |
| Jidoth | Lord's Port <br> Oth <br> Tirena <br> Videlsen |
| Mollen | Aldon <br> Exigot <br> Len City <br> Pelta <br> The Villages of Southern Aldon  <br> Vanna's Perch |
| Rise | Expanse <br> Mouth <br> Shelf |



Select 2 for Adventurer Options.

Then, a new Adventurer can be created with option 6.

When creating a new Adventurer, a user must choose their Personality Alignment and Job.
| Alignments: | \| | Jobs: |
| :---      |    :---:    |       ---: |
| Apathetic | \| | Brawler|
| Anarchic | \| | Director |
| Commercial | \| | Feral |
| Philanthropic | \| | Hopeless |
| Political | \| | Lookout |
| Religious | \| | Preacher |
| Social | \| | Shade |
|  | \| | Zealot |

Sometimes, it's useful to see how other users have built their characters to get an idea of popular Alignments for particular Jobs.  Using option 4 of the Adventurer Options submenu will present all Adventurers of a particular alignment
